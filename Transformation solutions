#Exercise 5.2.4

#Had an arrival delay two or more hours

filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)

#Flew to Houstion (IAH or HOU)

filter(flights, dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')


#Were operated by United, American, or Delta

filter(flights, carrier == 'UA', carrier ==  'AA', carrier == 'DAL')


# Departed in Summer(July, August and September)

filter(flights, month  == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9)

# Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late

filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120 & dep_delay <= 0)

# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

filter(flights, arr_delay >= 60 & dep_delay-arr_delay >30) 

# Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400 )

#Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). 
#What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

#This is a shortcut for x >= left & x <= right, 
#implemented efficiently in C++ for local values, 
#and translated to the appropriate SQL for remote tables.

filter(flights, between(month, 7,9))

filter(flights, between(dep_time, 601,2359))




#How many flights have a missing dep_time? 
#What other variables are missing? 
#What might these rows represent?

summary(flights)  

#Missing Flights 8255
#Other Missing Variables, Departure delay, Arrival Delay, Air Time, Arrival Time
#Could either be lost data, or flights that were later rerouted.

#Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? 

#NA^0 evaluates to 1, because anything to the power of 0 is 1. 

#Why is NA | TRUE not missing? 

#NA | TRUE, This evaluates to True because either of the terms could be true, so the whole expression returns TRUE

#Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)

#In 'FALSE & NA' one of the terms is Flase, so the whole expression evaluates to 'FALSE'
